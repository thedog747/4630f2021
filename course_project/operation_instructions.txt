Operation Instructions:
1.	On opening the application you will be met with a central view with two components, Calendar and Concepts.

2.	Starting with Calendar View, you can press the Add Task button to open the Add Task menu.
3.	From here you may add tasks to the DB. You can select the task's difficulty, describe it, and choose a date.
4.	Press "Submit" when you are ready to add your task. A toast should appear with the text "Success!" on success.
5.	Pressing android's back button to return, there is now a task. This is a RecyclerView that fills from the DB.
6.	Pressing "Complete" will toggle the task's completion status. Pressing "Delete" will remove it from the list.
7.	If you want to wipe out your current DB, press "Clear All" to remove all entries.

8.	Onto the Concepts View, which you can reach from the bottom button, press Add Link to add a link.
9.	From here you may add links to the other DB. Select a Title, paste the Link, then submit to see "Success!".
10.	There is now a link in a RecyclerView similar to the previous one. Links can be deleted the same way Tasks can.
11.	The "Copy" button will take whatever is stored in the Link field and copy it to your phone's clipboard.
12. The "Go" button will bring you to whatever valid web link is in the Link field.
13. Try making a task with "YouTube" as the title "https://www.youtube.com/" as the link.
14. Pressing "Go" on it from the Concepts View will open youtube in your browser.
15. If you have the YouTube app, it will redirect to the YouTube app for you, same with Twitter, Facebook, etc.

16. Now you know how to access all of Inception's features.
